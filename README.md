# AbstractShooter
Twin Stick Shooter

Requires Monogame 3.6 and OpenAL 3.0 (You can find its installer in the folder where MonoGame is installed)

I'm using VS2017 and the project is using Net Framework 4.6, but i guess you can also use Monogame 3.5, VS2015 and previous Net Framework versions, though you would need to recreate the project yourself.
